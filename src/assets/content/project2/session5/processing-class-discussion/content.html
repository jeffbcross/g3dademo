<h1>Interquartile Range Notes</h1>
<p>We have previously encountered measures of central tendency i.e. averages.
<p>We are now interest in finding the spread of the distribution rather than a central value. We have various types of spread similar to having various types of average.
<h1>Range</h1>
<p>The simplest measure to calculate is the range. This is simply the difference between the smallest and largest data values</p>

<p>Advantages: Easy to calculate, gives a general idea of the spread of a dataset</p>
<p>Disadvantages: Affected by outliers, values that are much smaller or larger than most of the other values, in a set of data</p>
<h1>Inter-quartile Range</h1>
<p>This is better than the range as we are only interested in the middle half of the data. We are therefore not as affected by outliers.</p>
<p>We first sort the data into ascending order and then circle the median (half way), lower quartile (one quarter way) and the upper quartile (three quarters way)</p>

<p>Interquartile range controls for outliers and gives a more precise measure of the range of the dataset.</p>
