<h1 class="session-header" [attr.data-num]="sessionNumber">TYPES OF GRAPHS AND CHARTS</h1>

<p>Graphs and charts are a great way to communicate information visually.</p>
<p>When selecting the best way to present your data, think about the purpose of your graph or chart and what you are trying to convey</p>
<p>Should your data be shown as percentages, categories or frequencies?</p>
<p>Is your data categorical or continuous?</p>
<p>Categorical- grouped into non-overlapping categories</p>
<p>Continuous- measured on a scale or continuum</p>
<p>There are four main types of graphs and they can help us show different types of information: bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and histograms.</p>

<h1>1. Bar Graph</h1>
<img style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" src="/assets/content/project2/session3/processing-activity/BarGraph.png">
<p>Composed of separate bars that represent different categories of data</p>
<p>Useful for displaying categorical data</p>
<p>Best used to compare values across different categories</p>
<p>Have an X and Y axis</p>

<h1>2. Pie Chart</h1>
<img style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" src="/assets/content/project2/session3/processing-activity/PieChart.png">
<p>Used to compare parts of a whole</p>
<p>Divided into sections that are equal in size to the quantity that is being represented</p>
<p>Can be helpful when data is represented with percentages</p>
<p>Used for displaying categorical data</p>

<h1>3. Line Graph</h1>
<img style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" src="/assets/content/project2/session3/processing-activity/LineGraph.png">
<p>Displays the relationship between two types of information</p>
<p>Useful in illustrating trends over time</p>
<p>Used for displaying categorical data</p>

<h1>4. Histogram</h1>
<img style="width:100%;max-width:600px;" src="/assets/content/project2/session3/processing-activity/Histogram.png">
<p>Has connected bars that display the history or proportion of information that fall within the designated columns</p>
<p>Used for displaying continues data such as weight and test scores</p>
<p>Columns can be varying width</p>

<h1>Guidelines for Formatting Graphs and Charts</h1>
<p>Use a clear title for your chart or graph to convey the purpose</p>
<p>Use the axis titles to specify the unit of measurement</p>
<p>Label each part of the graph (this can be done using a legend if necessary)</p>
<p>Use different colors to help readers distinguish different categories</p>
<p>Keep it simple, do not distract the reader from the data you are presenting</p>
