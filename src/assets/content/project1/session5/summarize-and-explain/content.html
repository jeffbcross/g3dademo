<h1>Types of Measurement</h1>
<p>It is important to know the type of data you are working with so that you can determine how to interpret, analyze and visualize
    it.
</p>
<p>Data can be separated into four main types:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td>
            Nominal Data
        </td>
        <td>
            Ordinal Data
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Interval Data
        </td>
        <td>
            Ratio Data
        </td>
    </tr>
