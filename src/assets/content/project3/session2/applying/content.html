<p>Girls will work together in groups/pairs/individually to outline the steps they will need to take to complete the project outline.</p>
<p>Allow girls time to think through the steps they have to take and list them out.  Guide them to:</p>
<p>a)     Realize that the manager wants to put more security in the young adult section because she thinks young adults shoplift more.</p>
<p>b)     Realize they will have to look up data on who shoplifts.</p>
<p>c)      Realize they will have to present the data clearly.</p>
<p>d)     Realize they have to visually represent the distribution of the data.</p>
<p>e)     Realize they will have to present an argument to their boss (as in memo, in professional language).</p>
<p>If they do not reach realizations on their own, give hints and discuss in detail.</p>
<p>Girls will share out steps to complete project</p>
