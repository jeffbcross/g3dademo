<h1>Different Schools - Different Scales</h1>
<p>With high schools across the country having different grading scales, one may wonder how colleges understand and
    interpret an applicant’s transcript. Some high schools have grading scales based on 100%, while others are based
    on 4.0, 5.0, and we’ve even seen 15.0. At some high schools, honors classes are given extra weight and AP or IB
    courses are given even more weight. So obviously a student who has a 4.0 GPA at one high school may not be
    comparable to a student who has a 5.0 GPA at another school.</p>
