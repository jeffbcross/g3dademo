<h1>Raising Your GPA</h1>
<p>While it is best to maintain a high GPA throughout high school, it is possible to raise your GPA if you have a poor semester.</p> 
<p>Ex: Jenn Finished her freshman year with a cumulative GPA of 1.5. She knows she will need at least a 3.0 by the end of her junior year to qualify for the school she wants to attend. What GPA will she need to earn the next 2 years to reach a 3.0?</p> 
<h1>Activity 2: </h1>
<p>Look up the average entering freshman GPA of three colleges you are interested in attending or have heard about.</p> 
<p>Encourage students to look at schools with a wider range of average entering freshman GPAs</p>
