<h1>Budget Excercise</h1>
<p>
    Create a monthly budget using your <strong>Status assignment</strong> and <strong>Health assignment</strong>. 
    Be realistic about how much you think you would spend and remember that any leftover money can be saved for the future or for other luxuries like vacation.
