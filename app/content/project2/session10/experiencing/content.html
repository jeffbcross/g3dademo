<h1>Re-Read Project Statement</h1>
<p>You notice that suspensions at your school are often given to the same group of students. You want to bring this up
    as a school wide issue that should be addressed by your peer-mentoring group.</p>
<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>Prepare a 3-minute speech to your fellow mentors convincing them that there is unequal school discipline in different
    groups. Do this by summarizing a comparison of the interquartile range and standard deviation of out-of-school
    suspension data for two groups. For example, find and compare interquartile range and standard deviation of the
    percent of out-of-school suspensions for students with disabilities vs. students without disabilities or Asian
    students vs. Hispanic, etc.</p>
